## First Turtles language

Now build your own basic Turtles language supporting sequences of basic commands from the demo video:
* forward and backward by some number of steps, e.g., `forward (9)`
* turning in a direction by some number of degreed, e.g., `turn right by 20 degrees`

HINT: you have access to the pre-defined rule INT that represents integer.

Frequently commit your changes and see your marks (formative) in the GitHub classroom.

Eventually, the autograding should pass and assign 30/30.

## Doing this activity

There are two ways to do this activity:

1. You can check out the repository and import the projects into Eclipse, then do the activity there. Commit your changes and push them back to GitHub to trigger the autograding so you can see whether you've correctly implemented the grammar. More information about checking out and editing code in Eclipse can be found on KEATS.
2. You can [do this activity in your browser](https://ep.mde-network.org/?activities=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7ccsmmdd/turtles1/master/activity.json&privaterepo=true). Click on the link and your browser will open the MDENet Education Platform with the activity pre-loaded. You can edit your grammar and test out the changes you have made by generating an editor. See the video on KEATS to find out how to do this. **Note that you must save your changes before switching to the generated editor or you will lose them.** Saving your changes will create a commit in your repository, which will also automatically trigger the autograding process.
